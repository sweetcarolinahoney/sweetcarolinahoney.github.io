        <h1 class="mt-4">Uber Diablo</h1>  
			<p>Uber Diablo is a Demon and a Superunique. He is also known as the Diablo Clone (DClone). He appears after Diablo's Soulstone has been sold. He can be spawned in any difficulty and drops uniques in Normal and Nightmare; in Hell he drops Annihilus charm. DClone also has a chance to drop Mark of the Devil in Nightmare difficulty. More info about Mark of the Devil can be found <a href="consumables.html">here</a>.</p>
			<p>When DClone spawns in a game the message "Diablo Walks the Earth" appears. The Uber Diablo can be found in the place of any Superunique in the game. He is substantially more powerful than the Diablo you face at the end of Act Four, with far more hit points, higher resistances, and the ability to deal out a lot more damage. He can also use a special version of the Druid's Armageddon spell, which causes fireballs down all around him.</p>
			<p>The Diablo's Soulstone is a special quest item. The Diablo's Soulstone is created in the Horadric Cube by cubing together four different Essences that drop infrequently from the act bosses in any difficulty.</p>
			<p>The Essences include:</p>
				<ul><li>Twisted Essence of Suffering</li>
					<li>Charged Essence of Hatred</li>
					<li>Burning Essence of Terror</li>
					<li>Festering Essence of Destruction</li></ul>

        <h1 class="mt-4">Pandemonium Event</h1>  
			<p>The initiation of the quest is pretty straightforward. It involves the collection of the three Keys that will open the portal to Uber Tristram, where the three Uber Prime Evils reside. But the key collection is in itself quite complex. The first step is retrieving three minor keys.</p>
			<p>To get the minor keys, the player has to kill one of the agents of the Prime Evils on the mortal plane. They are:</p>
				<ul><li>The Summoner (Mephisto)</li>
					<li>The Countess (Diablo)</li>
					<li>Nihlathak (Baal)</li></ul>
			<p>They need to be killed in a Hell difficulty game in which they have a chance to drop the Keys of Hate, Terror and Destruction respectively along with their normal drop. They drop it quite rarely, sometimes dropping only one in 10-15 runs, but you can still run any one of them and continue to collect only one type of key. It is advisable to only run them for the three keys that are required for quest completion.</p><p>They need to be killed in a Hell difficulty game in which they have a chance to drop the Keys of Hate, Terror and Destruction respectively along with their normal drop.

It is advisable to only run them for the three keys that are required for quest completion.</p>
			<p>Once you have a complete set of three different Minor Keys, go to Act V, Harrogath. Put them in the Horadric Cube and then transmute them. In a way, that is very similar to the Secret Cow Level, you will create a Portal teleporting you to a place where you would have to fight a more powerful agent of Evil:</p>
				<ul><li>Uber Duriel in the Forgotten Sands</li>
					<li>Uber Izual in the Furnace of Pain</li>
					<li>Lilith in the Matron's Den</li></ul>
			<p>They will drop, upon death, Baal's Eye, Mephisto's Brain, and Diablo's Horn respectively, the Major Keys that will help you create the Portal to Uber Tristram.</p>
			<p>Once you have all the three Major Keys, you can to go back to Harrogath and transmute them in the Horadric Cube. This will create the portal to Uber Tristram.</p>
			<p>Uber Tristram has the same base structure as the regular Tristram but has a pack-load of hellish monsters, like the rare and powerful Balrogs. There are also a variety of unique monsters, champions and their minions along with the masters of the pack, the Uber Prime Evils themselves. The main objective when the player reaches Uber Tristram is to find and defeat Uber Mephisto, Uber Baal, and Uber Diablo.</p>
			<p>Once you kill them, the last one to die will give you the Hellfire Torch and the Standard of Heroes. The Standard of Heroes can also be corrupted with Heroic Demon Shard, which will give you an additional modifier.</p>

        <h1 class="mt-4">The Goetia quest</h1>
			<p>The Goetia is a bonus quest. This quest can be accomplished in any difficulty, though seals only drop in Hell difficulty.</p>
			<p>Seals are new items that can only be obtained from new bosses in the Goetia quest. They are used for jewel crafting, similar to facets, but, if you get lucky, more powerful.</p>
			<p>Seal types:</p>
				<ul><li>Cold Seal of Frost Nova</li>
					<li>Fire Seal of Blaze</li>
					<li>Lightning Seal of Charged Bolt</li>
					<li>Poison Seal of Poison Explosion</li>

				<p><b>Paimon</b><br>The Ninth Spirit in this Order is Paimon, a Great King, and very obedient unto Lucifer. He appeareth in the form of a Man with a Crown most glorious upon his head. There goeth before him also an Host of Spirits, like Men with Trumpets and well sounding Cymbals, and all other sorts of Musical Instruments. He hath a great Voice, and roareth at his first coming, and his speech is such that the Magician cannot well understand unless he can compel him. This Spirit can teach all Arts and Sciences, and other secret things. He can discover unto thee what the Earth is, and what holdeth it up in the Waters; and what Mind is, and where it is; or any other thing thou mayest desire to know. He giveth Dignity, and confirmeth the same. He bindeth or maketh any man subject unto the Magician if he so desire it. He giveth good Familiars, and such as can teach all Arts. He is to be observed towards the West. He is of the Order of Dominations. He hath under him 200 Legions of Spirits, and part of them are of the Order of Angels, and the other part of Potentates. Now if thou callest this Spirit Paimon alone, thou must make him some offering; and there will attend him two Kings called Labal and Abalim, and also other Spirits who be of the Order of Potentates in his Host, and 25 Legions. And those Spirits which be subject unto them are not always with them unless the Magician do compel them. His Character is this which must be worn as a Lamen before thee, etc.</p>
